# Goalkeeper 

The "Goalkeeper" project is a simulation of a robot goalkeeper implemented in C, utilizing the Pthreads library 
for concurrent programming and the Allegro library for graphics rendering. The simulation involves a goalkeeper 
consisting of a cart that moves along a guide to intercept an incoming ball. The system integrates visual sensing,
motor simulation, control, and display functionalities, each implemented as separate tasks.
